        lyrics: "One day I made a wish And mostly it came true But I forgot to be specific Now I’m trying to get to you But you don’t get me I said a branch has snapped You said the whole tree died And I knew you were right But I recall the sunlight on autumn leaves Overcast in amber Twisting in the wind You pretty thief Snuck through an open door Then faded by the cold winter’s eve Another year has passed Saw you walking to her car Holding her hand Opening her door What did it mean Who was it all for? And It’s there my love The days remain alive One chapter, you and I Shining like sunlight on autumn leaves Overcast in amber Twisting in the wind You pretty thief Snuck through an open door Then faded by the cold winter’s eve",
