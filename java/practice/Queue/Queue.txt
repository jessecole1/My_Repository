Queue is present in the java.util package 

Queue extends the Collection interface 

Queue is an ordered list, FIFO 

Elements are added at the tail

Elements are removed/popped from the head 

Elements are retrieved from the order they were entered into the list. 

Queue is an interface, objects cannot be created out of Queue alone. So it needs a concrete class 

Most common concrete classes are PriorityQueue and LinkedList 
    - Note: Neither of these classes are thread-safe
